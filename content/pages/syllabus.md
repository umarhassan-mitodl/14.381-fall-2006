## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

## Description

The course introduces statistical theory to prepare students for the remainder of the econometrics sequence. The emphasis of the course is to understand the basic principles of statistical theory. A brief review of probability will be given; however, this material is assumed knowledge. The course also covers basic regression analysis. Topics covered include probability, random samples, asymptotic methods, point estimation, evaluation of estimators, Cramer-Rao theorem, hypothesis tests, Neyman Pearson lemma, Likelihood Ratio test, interval estimation, best linear predictor, best linear approximation, conditional expectation function, building functional forms, regression algebra, Gauss-Markov optimality, finite-sample inference, consistency, asymptotic normality, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this course include Calculus (18.02) and permission of the instructor.

## Course Requirements

Each week there are two lectures and a recitation.

The problem sets will be due roughly every two weeks. The answer key to the problems in _Statistical Inference_ will be available. It is important to do problems and to try and solve those problems without having seen the answers.

## Texts

### Part 1

The text, which will be followed closely, is:

Casella, George, and Roger Berger. _Statistical Inference_. 2{{< sup "nd" >}} ed. Pacific Grove, CA: Thomson Learning, 2001. ISBN: 9780534243128.

This book covers all of the material in Part 1 and provides many problems for practice as well as excellent references.

### Part 2

Greene, William. _Econometric Analysis_. 5{{< sup "th" >}} ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2002. ISBN: 9780130661890.

Errors in the 5{{< sup "th" >}} edition may be found [here](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wgreene/Text/econometricanalysis.htm).

You can also find the material in any standard text on regression.

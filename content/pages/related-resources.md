Measurability
-------------

In this class, we do not need to worry about measurability, since it is not essential for understanding any of the key concepts. Here is a good, quick reference: Koenker, Roger. "Appendix to 13 Ways." [Economics 574 Lecture Notes](http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/courses/), Spring 2006.

Introduction to R
-----------------

This document composed by Grant Farnsworth explains how to use R, a free statistics language. ([PDF](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Farnsworth-EconometricsInR.pdf))
